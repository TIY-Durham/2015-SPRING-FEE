# 00 -- Ready Player One

## Back to Basics (Optional)

If you're brand new to the Mac, you're probably already getting a bit confused by the differences in conventions and crazy symbols. _Don't Panic!_ There's [a great support article on Apple.com called _Mac Basics_](https://www.apple.com/support/macbasics/) to get you started. Regardless of how good you think you are at typing, a lot of the mistakes you make at first will be simple typographic errors. If you _don't_ know how to touch type (i.e. without looking at the keyboard), start practicing _now_ with http://www.keybr.com/. If you're fairly confident in your typing ability, try working through the JavaScript lessons on http://typing.io

## GitHubbing to Know You

If you haven't already, [create a GitHub account](http://github.com/signup) (or use your existing one) and [edit your GitHub profile](https://github.com/settings/profile). Add a _recent, clear picture_ so we can recognize your face, _your full name_ so we can recognize your name, _a valid public email address_ so we can contact you. _Star the class project_, if you haven't already, and read through [the wiki](../wiki)...

### You've Got Issues

[Create an Issue in the class repo (this one)](https://github.com/TIY-Durham/2015-FALL-FEE/issues/new) and name it `00 -- YOUR NAME`, where `YOUR NAME` is, well... your name. Your real, full name. If you copy and paste the checklist from the **Tasks** sections below into the **Description** of your issue _as is_, you should end up with a bunch of checkboxes thanks to [the way that GitHub interprets text](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). As you complete parts of the assignment, check off the corresponding checkboxes and watch your progress bar fill! Read [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) for more information on creating issues in GitHub.

_This task list should be complete by the first day of class!_

### Send all my GitHub to you...

Finally, if you haven't guessed it yet, GitHub is a tool we'll use very heavily in the class and is highly respected in the industry. Learn all you can about `git` -- the command -- and GitHub! There are [some helpful Guides on GitHub](http://guides.github.com) to help you get started, but start with [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and [Fork-and-Spoon](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)

## Command Line Training

In this class, we're going to use the Command Line Interface (CLI) _a lot_. Start with [_An Intro to the OS X Command Line_](http://eddywashere.com/blog/an-intro-to-the-os-x-command-line/) and [_Learn the Command Line_ on CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line/). If you're looking for more of a challenge, you can try the [_CLI Crash Course_ by Zed Shaw](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/).

## INSTALL ALL THE THINGS!

Throughout the course, we'll be using a lot of tools, some of them on day 1. _Please have these installed on your Mac before we get started on Monday!_ If you have trouble, please put a comment on your WIP Issue and notify us via email. _Don't stop!_

### Prezto Change-oh!

One of the tools we'll frequently use in class is Prezto. To test your Google Fu and GitHub prowess: find, fork, and install Prezto on GitHub. The install instructions are a little tricky, so pay careful attention. If you get stuck, please leave a comment on your issue and move on.

## Take a Moment to Reflect

Please answer the following questions in short essay form. Try to keep each answer between 200-500 words (3-5 paragraphs). Don't worry about grammar or spelling -- use this time to reflect on yourself and your upcoming adventure!  Please submit your answers as a comment on your WIP Issue. 

1. What difficulties do you predict that you will encounter during our course? How have you reacted to similar situations in the past? How do you plan on reacting to these situations during the class?
1. Which part of the prework did you like the MOST? Which part of the prework did you like the LEAST? If you found any of the prework confusing, please explain.

## Extracurricular Activities

You might notice by now that GitHub does something funny with the text that you write. It's using a simple formatting system called [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and it adds a little of its own flavor. To learn more about Markdown and how GitHub uses it, check out [_Explaining Markdown_ on Team Treehouse](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/explaining-markdown) and [_Mastering Markdown_ on in the GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

There are two books that I suggest you start reading. They're both avaialble in digital format on various devices, and they're both relatively easy reads:

* [_Getting Things Done_ by David Allen](http://j.mp/134jABk)
* [_Pragmatic Thinking and Learning_ by Andy Hunt](http://j.mp/1D5nmu8)
